## Description
---
Flores Rosa Emilia was a project born of passion to help out a family member of our group have a website that suited their business needs. We wanted to construct something that truly encompassed the talent and love that goes in to each hand-made product, while also providing the functions needed to run a website for a business that fulfills orders. This gives the user a stand-alone site to visit rather than a generic Facebook page or by word-of-mouth, and better yet, a place to browse a full array of products.
